# Users & Queries

Queries for analyzing costs at the user and individual query level, including expensive queries and user spending patterns.

**Semantic keywords:** users, queries, expensive queries, costly queries, top users, user costs, who is spending, query cost, parameterized, query patterns, user increase, biggest bills, query attribution, parameterized hash, grouped by hash

### Most Expensive Individual Queries - Last Week

**Triggered by:** "Which individual queries consumed the most compute credits last week?", "most expensive queries", "top costly queries"

```sql
SELECT 
   qa.query_id, 
   qa.warehouse_name, 
   qa.user_name, 
   ROUND(qa.credits_attributed_compute, 2) AS credits_compute, 
   ROUND(qa.credits_used_query_acceleration, 2) AS credits_qas,
   qa.start_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY qa 
WHERE qa.start_time >= CURRENT_DATE - 7 
  AND qa.credits_attributed_compute > 0 
ORDER BY qa.credits_attributed_compute DESC 
LIMIT 15;
```

### Top 5 Queries Grouped by Parameterized Hash (with Example Query Text)

**Triggered by:** "Show me my top queries grouped by parameterized hash?", "What are the top 5 queries grouped by parameterized hash?", "query patterns by cost", "top queries by hash", "parameterized query costs", "Which parameterized queries were the most expensive last week?", "expensive query patterns", "query families", "show me an example query for each hash"

```sql
SELECT
    query_parameterized_hash,
    ROUND(SUM(credits_attributed_compute), 2) AS total_credits,
    COUNT(query_id) AS execution_count,
    ROUND(SUM(credits_attributed_compute) / NULLIF(COUNT(query_id), 0), 4) AS avg_credits_per_execution,
    ANY_VALUE(query_id) AS example_query_id
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_DATE())
  AND start_time < CURRENT_DATE()
  AND query_parameterized_hash IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY query_parameterized_hash
ORDER BY total_credits DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Top Users by Query Costs

**Triggered by:** "What users are spending the most?", "Which users are spending the most?", "Who is spending the most?", "user costs"

```sql
SELECT 
    user_name, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT query_id) AS query_count, 
    ROUND(SUM(credits_attributed_compute + COALESCE(credits_used_query_acceleration, 0)), 2) AS total_credits 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    AND start_time < CURRENT_DATE() 
GROUP BY user_name 
ORDER BY total_credits DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### Top 5 Users with Greatest Increase in Query Cost

**Triggered by:** "Who are the top-5 users with the greatest increase in query cost?", "user cost increase", "who increased spending?"

```sql
WITH monthly_user_spend AS (
    SELECT user_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', start_time) AS spend_month, SUM(credits_attributed_compute) AS total_credits 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY 
    WHERE start_time >= DATE_TRUNC('month', DATEADD('month', -2, CURRENT_DATE())) 
        AND start_time < DATE_TRUNC('month', DATEADD('month', 1, CURRENT_DATE())) 
    GROUP BY user_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', start_time)
), 
user_comparison AS (
    SELECT user_name, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN spend_month = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE()) THEN total_credits ELSE 0 END) AS current_month_credits, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN spend_month = DATE_TRUNC('month', DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE())) THEN total_credits ELSE 0 END) AS previous_month_credits 
    FROM monthly_user_spend 
    GROUP BY user_name
) 
SELECT user_name, 
    ROUND(current_month_credits, 2) AS current_month_credits, 
    ROUND(previous_month_credits, 2) AS previous_month_credits, 
    ROUND(current_month_credits - previous_month_credits, 2) AS credit_increase, 
    CASE WHEN previous_month_credits > 0 
        THEN ROUND(((current_month_credits - previous_month_credits) / previous_month_credits) * 100, 2) 
        ELSE NULL END AS percentage_increase 
FROM user_comparison 
WHERE current_month_credits > previous_month_credits 
ORDER BY (current_month_credits - previous_month_credits) DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Top 5 Users with Biggest Bills (Comprehensive)

**Triggered by:** "Which are the top 5 individuals who ran up the biggest bills?", "Who are the biggest spenders?", "user costs efficiently"

```sql
WITH user_direct_costs AS (
    SELECT qa.user_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(qa.credits_attributed_compute), 4) AS query_compute_credits, 
        ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(qa.credits_used_query_acceleration, 0)), 4) AS query_acceleration_credits, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT qa.query_id) AS total_queries, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT qa.warehouse_id) AS warehouses_used 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY qa 
    WHERE qa.start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    GROUP BY qa.user_name

    SELECT ca.username AS user_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(ca.credits), 4) AS cortex_analyst_credits, 
        SUM(ca.request_count) AS analyst_requests 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_ANALYST_USAGE_HISTORY ca 
    WHERE ca.start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    GROUP BY ca.username
) 
SELECT COALESCE(udc.user_name, ucc.user_name) AS user_name, 
    ROUND(COALESCE(udc.query_compute_credits, 0) + COALESCE(udc.query_acceleration_credits, 0) + COALESCE(ucc.cortex_analyst_credits, 0), 4) AS total_user_bill,
