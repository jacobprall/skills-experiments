### Where is my money going - Service Breakdown

**Triggered by:** "Where is my money going?", "What am I spending on?", "Show me my costs", "cost breakdown", "spending breakdown", "complete breakdown of spending"

```sql
SELECT 
    service_type, 
    ROUND(SUM(credits_used), 2) AS total_credits, 
    ROUND(SUM(credits_used) / SUM(SUM(credits_used)) OVER () * 100, 1) AS percentage_of_total 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    AND start_time < CURRENT_DATE() 
GROUP BY service_type 
ORDER BY total_credits DESC;
```

---

### Total Credits Used - Last Week

**Triggered by:** "How many credits were used last week?", "total credits", "weekly usage"

```sql
SELECT 
    'current_period' AS time, 
    ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(credits_used), 0), 2) AS credits_used 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    AND start_time < CURRENT_DATE();
```

---

### Credits by Service Type - Last Week

**Triggered by:** "How much did I spend by service type last week?", "service type costs", "breakdown by service"

```sql
SELECT 
    service_type, 
    ROUND(SUM(credits_used), 2) AS credits_used 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    AND start_time < CURRENT_DATE() 
GROUP BY service_type 
ORDER BY credits_used DESC;
```

### Which Service is Consuming the Most?

**Triggered by:** "Which service is consuming the most money?", "top service by cost", "most expensive service"

```sql
SELECT 
    service_type, 
    ROUND(SUM(credits_used), 2) AS total_credits, 
    COUNT(*) AS usage_records, 
    ROUND(AVG(credits_used), 4) AS avg_credits_per_hour, 
    MIN(start_time) AS first_usage, 
    MAX(start_time) AS last_usage 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
GROUP BY service_type 
ORDER BY total_credits DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Top 5 Most Expensive Resources Across All Categories

**Triggered by:** "Which are the 5 most expensive warehouses, cortex services, compute pools, databases?", "top resources overall"

```sql
WITH warehouse_costs AS (
    SELECT 'WAREHOUSE' AS resource_type, warehouse_name AS resource_name, ROUND(SUM(credits_used), 2) AS total_credits 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY 
    WHERE start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    GROUP BY warehouse_name
), 
cortex_function_costs AS (
    SELECT 'CORTEX_FUNCTION' AS resource_type, CONCAT(function_name, ' (', COALESCE(model_name, 'default'), ')') AS resource_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(token_credits), 4) AS total_credits 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY 
    WHERE start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    GROUP BY function_name, model_name
),

    SELECT 'COMPUTE_POOL' AS resource_type, compute_pool_name AS resource_name, ROUND(SUM(credits_used), 2) AS total_credits 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES_HISTORY 
    WHERE start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    GROUP BY compute_pool_name
), 
all_resources AS (
    SELECT * FROM warehouse_costs 
    UNION ALL SELECT * FROM cortex_function_costs 
    UNION ALL SELECT * FROM compute_pool_costs
) 
SELECT resource_type, resource_name, total_credits 
FROM all_resources 
ORDER BY total_credits DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Team Attribution Across Major Cost Categories

**Triggered by:** "Which teams consumed the most across warehouse, cortex, and storage costs?", "team attribution comprehensive"

```sql
WITH team_warehouse_costs AS (
    SELECT tr.tag_name AS tag_key, tr.tag_value AS team_name, ROUND(SUM(wm.credits_used), 2) AS warehouse_credits 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY wm 
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TAG_REFERENCES tr ON wm.warehouse_name = tr.object_name 
    WHERE tr.domain = 'WAREHOUSE' AND tr.tag_value IS NOT NULL AND tr.tag_value != '' 
        AND wm.start_time >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE()) 
    GROUP BY tr.tag_name, tr.tag_value
),

    SELECT tr.tag_name AS tag_key, tr.tag_value AS team_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(ds.average_database_bytes + ds.average_failsafe_bytes + COALESCE(ds.average_hybrid_table_storage_bytes, 0)) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024), 4) AS storage_tb 
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY ds 
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TAG_REFERENCES tr ON ds.database_name = tr.object_name
